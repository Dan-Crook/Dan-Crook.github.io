      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <p>The aim of the game is to successfully use all the numbers in your box.</p>
      <p>To do this, you will need to select numbers from your box that when added together equal the total of the two dice that are generated at the start of each round.</p>
      <p>You can select and use as many numbers from your box as you want, as long as the total equals the total of the dice. Once you are happy with your selection, Submit your answer to receive the next set of dice and start the next round.  Numbers used in that round cannot be used again.</p>
      <p>If at any point, the total of the dice cannot be made by the numbers you have left then you Lose!</p>
      <p>If you manage to use all your numbers, you Win!</p>
